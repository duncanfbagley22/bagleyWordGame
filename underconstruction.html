    <ul>
        <li>Black squares will be invisible, just helpful for positioning right now</li>
        <li>All design and formatting is just a placeholder for now. Primarily focused on function</li>
        <li>The question mark icon will cause a display of "How to play"</li>
        <li>The X1 icon will display a window of how many points each word is worth</li>
        <li>Planning to add double letter squares, triple letter squares, negative letter squares, etc.</li>
        <li>Target score may become a range rather than an exact score</li>
        <li>Right now, target score is pretty random. Will come up with a more systematic approach</li>
        <li>Could be daily levels, a list of levels, random levels, etc.</li>
        <li>Looking to add other constraints, but haven't decided what yet</li>
    </ul>
