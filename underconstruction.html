        <li>All design and formatting is just a placeholder for now. Primarily focused on function</li>
        <li>Target score may become a range rather than an exact score</li>
        <li>Right now, target score is pretty random. Will come up with a more systematic approach</li>
        <li>No guarantee that a given score is possible until a systematic scoring approach is finalized</li>
        <li>Could be daily levels, a list of levels, random levels, etc.</li>
        <li>Looking to add other constraints, but haven't decided what yet</li>
